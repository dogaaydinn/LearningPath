    /*
     Managed code lets you run the code on a managed CLR runtime environment in the .NET framework. 
       Managed code runs on the managed runtime environment than the operating system itself. 
       Benefits: Provides various services like a garbage collector, exception handling, etc. 
       
       Unmanaged code is when the code doesn’t run on CLR, it is an unmanaged code that works outside the .NET framework. 
       They don’t provide services of the high-level languages and therefore, run without them. Such an example is C++.
