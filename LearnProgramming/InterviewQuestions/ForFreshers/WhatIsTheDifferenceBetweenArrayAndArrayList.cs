public class WhatIsTheDifferenceBetweenArrayAndArrayList
{
    /*
     An array is a collection of similar variables clubbed together under one common name. While ArrayList is a collection of objects that can be indexed individually. With ArrayList you can access a number of features like dynamic memory allocation, adding, searching, and sorting items in the ArrayList. 
     * When declaring an array the size of the items is fixed therefore, the memory allocation is fixed. But with ArrayList, it can be increased or decreased dynamically.
       Array belongs to system.array namespace while ArrayList belongs to the system.collection namespace.
       All items in an array are of the same datatype while all the items in an ArrayList can be of the same or different data types.
       While arrays cannot accept null, ArrayList can accept null values.
