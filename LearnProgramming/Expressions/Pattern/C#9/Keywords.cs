     4. Pattern Matching Enhancements
       C# 9 contains fresh new pattern matching improvements. Some of them are as follows:
       Type patterns match a variable is a kind
       Parenthesized patterns emphasize or stress the precedence of combinations of patterns
       Conjunctive and patterns need both the patterns for the match
       Disjunctive or patterns need anyone patterns for matching
       Negated not patterns need that a pattern does not match
       Relational patterns need the input to be lesser, greater, or greater than, or equal less than or equal to the given
       These patterns enhance the syntax for patterns
